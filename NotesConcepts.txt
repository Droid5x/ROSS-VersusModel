Notes & Concepts for Versus Model:
Concept: to avoid ordering conflicts for self events, replace all self events with code that will run every time and event is received. Or Retain only resource add events, which then run the code to do self maintenance (rebuild, scaleup/scaledown, expand, and declare war.) Doing this may make the reverse event handler much more complicated though.
-- Somewhat implemented by making timings for self-events stricter


Concept: add a random element to the # of resources that the LPs get on every ADD-RESOURCES event
-- Implemented

Concept: Add a size-based relationship to the maximum health attainable. Also do something about the terribly consistent maximum scale_up value.
- Partially Completed

Add Stat tracking to keep track of LP number of times surrendered, battles won, and battles declared
-- Implemented

TODO: Update the reverse event handler to match changes in the main handler
--DONE

6/12/15:
TODO: Cull as many internal LP events as possible and incorportate them into ADD_RESOURCES. External events should stay but be refined, probably.
-- IN PROGRESS

TODO: Update the reverse event handler to match changes in the main handler...in time.

TODO: Fix LP-Stat printouts, since they seem to interrupt each other and overlap.
